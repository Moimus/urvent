# urvent - „UrVent“
NOTE: this project was moved to my own repo
This is a Java project within the context of a software project during studies.
This System provides a client to create & manage events like parties and an API for the communication between client and database.</br>
</br>
Priority of this project is to develop easily expandable groundwork for our app by implementing a basic MVVM pattern, so we can maybe build up on that after finishing the exam.
